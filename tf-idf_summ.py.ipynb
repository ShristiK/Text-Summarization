      "Federer has been handed a difficult draw where could could come across Kevin Anderson, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in the latter rounds. He used his first break point to close out the first set before going up 3-0 in the second and wrapping up the win on his first match point. Federer's projected route to the Paris final could also lead to matches against Kevin Anderson and Novak Djokovic. Two players, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Kyle Edmund, won their first career ATP titles last week (13:26). 'BASEL, Switzerland (AP), Roger Federer advanced to the 14th Swiss Indoors final of his career by beating seventh-seeded Daniil Medvedev 6-1, 6-4 on Saturday. Nadal's appearance in Paris is a big boost to the tournament organisers who could see Roger Federer withdraw. Major players feel that a big event in late November combined with one in January before the Australian Open will mean too much tennis and too little rest. Meanwhile, Federer is hoping he can improve his service game as he hunts his ninth Swiss Indoors title this week. Seeking a ninth title at his hometown event, and a 99th overall, Federer will play 93th-ranked Marius Copil on Sunday. But as it stands, Federer is in the draw and is scheduled to face either former world No 3 Milos Raonic or Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round. Federer's success in Basel last week was the ninth time he has won his hometown tournament. Currently in ninth place, Nishikori with a win could move to within 125 points of the cut for the eight-man event in London next month. Copil upset expectations of a Federer final against Alexander Zverev in a 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-4 win over the fifth-ranked German in the earlier semifinal. \"On Monday, I am free and will look how I feel,\" Federer said after winning the Swiss Indoors. But with the ATP World Tour Finals due to begin next month, Nadal is ready to prove his fitness before the season-ending event at the 02 Arena. Anderson has a shot at a fifth career title and second of the year after winning in New York in February. \"I think there is a really nice environment and a great atmosphere, especially between some of the veteran players helping some of the younger players out.\n"
